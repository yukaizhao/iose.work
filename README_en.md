# Intent-Oriented Software Engineering

> When large model agents possess powerful execution capabilities, human core value will completely shift from "How to implement" to "What to implement" and "Why implement it."

## About This Book

*Intent-Oriented Software Engineering* (IOSE) is a systematic guide and open-source e-book on the paradigm shift of software engineering in the AI era. This book systematically explores the complete path of transition from traditional software engineering to Intent-Oriented Software Engineering and provides practical transformation guidance for technical teams. Whether you are a technical manager, architect, developer, or entrepreneur, you can gain profound insights and practical guidelines about the future of software engineering from this book.

## Reading Suggestions

1. **Progressive Reading**: This book is organized in a progressive logic of "Understanding → Transition → Practice → Outlook"; it is recommended to read in order.
2. **Combine with Practice**: Each chapter comes with practical templates and checklists; it is recommended to try them out in your team while reading.
3. **Continuous Iteration**: Intent-oriented software engineering is still rapidly evolving; maintain an open mindset and continuously adjust your understanding.

## Core Concepts Overview

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Intent** | Clear expression of "what is wanted" and "why," rather than "how to do it" |
| **Business Intent** | Top-level business goals, describing value propositions and business logic |
| **Constraint Network** | Five-dimensional quality space from passive documentation to executable code (architecture, complexity, security, performance, maintainability), serving as the "quality contract" for human-AI collaboration and the "real-time textbook" for agents |
| **Agent Engineer** | Technical role evolving from the execution layer to the orchestration layer, acting as the "chief architect" commanding agent clusters to deliver complex systems |

## Core Perspectives

- **Intent Layering**: Business intent defines "what is wanted"; technical intent defines "where the boundaries are."
- **Paradigm Shift**: A fundamental shift from "writing code" to "defining intent."
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Humans are responsible for intent; AI is responsible for implementation.
